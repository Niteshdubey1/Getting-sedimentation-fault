# Getting-sedimentation-fault-
Greetings. I am a student working on multiphase flows and writing this mail from India. I am using SediFoam solver for my case.  Presently, I am trying to understand (heavy) particles and their dynamics injected in T-like junctions. Some how my particles are not washed away from the outlet branches and getting reflected back.I have tried options at in.lammps,  for example using boundary    ff ff ff etc. some how the particle are either reflecting back or segmentation fault is taking place after executing it for some time.  I am wondering whether you can help me in that regard. If you would like to see my test case files then I can send them also.  Thank you very much. Nitesh
